Python Brainfuck Interpreter
=============================

Interpret [brainfuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) code programs with Python 3!

## Evaluating

Just run:
```shell
python bf.py [file name]
```

For example:
```shell
python bf.py rot-13.bf
```
And it will evaluate your brainfuck code!

## Debugging
The python-brainfuck-interpretter is coded with a debug operation which can be accessed using the `$`

So if you don't know why your brainfuck code isnt working, you can add the `$` before and after the
code you want to debug to toggle the debug state on or off.

*Happy coding*
